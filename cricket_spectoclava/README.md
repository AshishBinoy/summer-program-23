## Problem Statement 

Cricket, a captivating sport with its intricate dynamics, is shaped by a multitude of 
factors, both known and unknown such as pitch conditions, player performance (recent 
form), team dynamics, and historical performance data, that play a significant role in 
determining match outcomes. We aim to explore the various conditions that affect the 
game of cricket and propose a framework using a dashboard to predict matchups between 
players and teams.This framework will aid in making informed decisions to form the most efficient and 
competitive ‘Playing Eleven’ for tournaments, considering the diverse factors mentioned 
above.The model utilizes a comprehensive approach that incorporates statistical analysis, data 
mining, and machine learning techniques to analyse and interpret the vast amount of 
available cricket data. By considering the aforementioned factors, the proposed model 
seeks to uncover hidden patterns using data manipulation to generate features that 
contribute to the game's outcome. This framework provides a reliable foundation for predicting player matchups, enabling 
teams and selectors to make strategic decisions while selecting the ‘Playing Eleven’. This 
will help by identifying key strengths and weaknesses of individual players and assessing 
their performance against specific opponents, teams can maximize their chances of 
success.
